# Physics Simulation with OpenGL
Inspired by https://github.com/kavan010/gravity_sim
## Progress
- Primed with OpenGL and rendered first circle successfully
- Simple Newtonian gravity simulation with ball drop, bouncing until no momentum complete
- Multiple ball objects with horizontal velocities (but no inter-collision)
